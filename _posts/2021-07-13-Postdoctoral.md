Job Title: Postdoctoral fellow/ Scientific programmer <br />
Contract Period : 01/04/2022 â€“ 31/03/2025 (3 years)<br /><br />
Job duties & Responsibilities: <br />
  
The project aims to develop a new method for T2T haplotype resolved de novo assembly. To achieve this goal, we plan to use algorithms and AI methods on graphs and strings. The project will start with our recently developed Raven assembler https://github.com/lbcb-sci/raven .<br /><br />
 
The recent successful reconstruction of haploid Chm13 human cell line proved that it is possible to reconstruct a genome from telomere to telomere correctly using existing sequencing technologies. <br /><br />
 
This project is part of an ambitious Asian Reference Genome project that aims to correctly reconstruct genomes of 150 participants (Chinese, Malay and India), integrate them into a pangenome, and create tools to use them in the Singaporean National Precision Medicine program. <br /><br />
  
In this role, one will be part of a multi-disciplinary team consisting of computer
scientists, biologists, and bioinformaticians. Duties include:   <br /><br />
  
(i) developing algorithms or graphs and strings for de novo genome assembly (postdoc or scientific programmer). <br />
or <br />
(ii) reconstructing and curating assemblies (postdoc) <br /> <br />

Requirements:<br />
- BSc, MSc or PhD in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or a related discipline. <br />
- Very proficient in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python) <br />
- Familiarity with Unix Shell and experience with clusters/HPC system <br />
- Excellent communication skills in written and spoken English <br /> <br />
Optional (any of this):<br />
- Experience in long read genome assembly and genome annotation  <br />
- Strong programming skills (i.e. C/C++, Rust) <br />
- Deep knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures <br />
- Knowledge of modern supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning methods <br />
- Active knowledge of PyTorch, Tensorflow or similar deep learning frameworks <br />
